## Prerequisites

- OpenCV
- Docker
- Django
- matlibplot
- numpy

## Note
- No effort was put into making this clean and efficient. The code and implementation will need
to be improved.

## Lessons
- You need to specify an ARM image for docker-compose

## Issues
- Unable to build a docker with scikit-image. This resulted in a big change to the code
design
- Django files are created in the wrong folders, they needed to be moved around after creating the
docker image.
